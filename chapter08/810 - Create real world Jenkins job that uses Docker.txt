# Create a new Jenkis pipeline job

# Set poll from SCM at
H/5 * * * *

# using pipeline from SCM
# enter the url for our dqs-example-app
https://github.com/EarlWaud/dqs-example-app.git

# Save configuration
# Build the job

# the job errors due to the Jenkinsfile having the wrong name for the Registry
# it should have been ubuntu-node00 instead of ubuntu-node01

# update the project file and push to github
# the just will kick off with the poll from SCM

# The job builds successfully

# pull the newly built Doker image
docker pull ubuntu-node00:5000/dqs-example-app:latest

# run a container based on the new app image
docker container run -d --rm -p 8000:8000 ubuntu-node00:5000/dqs-example-app:latest

# browse to the app
ubuntu-node00:8000

# All that is left to do now is celebrate our success!
